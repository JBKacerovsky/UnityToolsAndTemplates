# UnityToolsAndTemplates

Repo where I collect different snippits, tools, and templates for setting up new unity projects.

## Subdirectories
1. [PackageManifest](https://github.com/JBKacerovsky/UnityToolsAndTemplates/tree/main/PackageManifest) different versions of the manifest.json file. Replace the content of Packages/manifest.json with these templates to setup packages (instead of having to individually delete and add in the Package manager).
